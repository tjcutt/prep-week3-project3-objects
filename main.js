*** THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION: OBJECTS ***

Below are a number of problems for you to solve
using JS. The JS code can be written below each
problem and the result can be displayed in the HTML page.

For any methods that we didn't cover, please refer to the Object Documentation.

Discovering new things is fun and a great way to learn!!

// 1. Create an object called "me" that describes you with your name, city, and job title.
//    Display the content of the object in the HTML page. 





// 2. To your "me" object, add a key of "family" with the value being an array of three of your family members and display in the HTML page.
// Example of desired output: { name: 'Bob Smith',
//                              city: 'Denver',
//                              jobTitle: 'professional wrestler',
//                              family: ['Joan', 'Kyle', 'Hank'] }






// 3. Using the "me" object, use dot notation and bracket notation to access the value of your city and display the results in the HTML page.








// Use the following Object for questions 4-9:
var invitees = { adults: [{
                          name: "Penny",
                          table: 10,
                          dinnerChoice: ["salad", "beef", "ice cream"]
                        },
                        {
                          name: "Billy",
                          table: 12,
                          dinnerChoice: ["soup", "beef", "sorbet"]
                        },
                        {
                          name: "Lauren",
                          table: 3,
                          dinnerChoice: ["soup", "chicken", "ice cream"],
                          specialConsiderations: { allergies: "melon",
                                                   seating: "Don't sit her next to ex husband at table 8."}
                        }
                        ],
                  children: [{
                             name: "Junior",
                             table: 4,
                             allergies: ["nuts"]
                            },
                            { name: "Pablo",
                            table: 4,

                            { name: "Ada",
                            table: 4,
                            allergies: ["boys"]
                            }

// 11. To your "jsWorkshop" object, assign a key of "classmates" with the value being an array of five your classmates.

// 12. Get the length of the fourth classmate's name.

// 13. Clear the classmates value.






// ADVANCED TRACK
// A. Create an empty object called "books".

// B. Create three book objects that contain book titles, their author, and number of pages.
//     The name of each object should be some kind of made up ISBN number.
//     (Feel free to make up the titles. And the authors. Have fun. No pressure.)
//     Insert the three objects into the "books" object.

// Final desired result:
    // var books = {ISBN22222:  {
    //                             title: "You Had Me at Woof",
    //                             author: "Julie Klum",
    //                             pages: 207
    //                           },
    //              ISBN33333:  {
    //                             title: "The Catcher in the Rye",
    //                             author: "JD Salinger",

    //                           },
    //              ISBN44444:  {
    //                             title: "Bangkok Haunts",
    //                             author: "John Burdett",
    //                             pages: 569,
    //                           }
    //             }

// C. Access the author of the first book.

// D. Get the length of the author the the third book.

// E. To each book object variable, add a key of "dateRead" with a value of the year you read the book.
//     (Go ahead and make this up, too. Get wild.)

// F. Remove the second book from the books object.

// G. Explain, in your own words, the difference between Literal Notation and Constructor Notation.
